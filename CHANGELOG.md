# Changelog

All notable changes to Team-Shinchan will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [4.17.0] - 2026-03-19

### BREAKING CHANGE
- **Git commits deferred to Stage 4 (Completion)**: `git commit` and `git push` are now blocked during Stage 3 (execution) via `workflow-guard.sh`. Commits are deferred to Stage 4 after Action Kamen review passes. Quick Fix paths are unaffected.

### Added
- **Plan Mode native integration** (BM): Nene calls `EnterPlanMode`/`ExitPlanMode` in Stage 2 planning. Advisory log in `transition-gate.sh` for requirements→planning transition.
- **Token usage tracking** (BM): `write-tracker.sh` records `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `cache_write_tokens` with graceful null fallback. `analytics.js --cost` flag for estimated cost report by model/session.
- **Agent self-observation feedback loop** (BM): `getFailureHints(agentName)` in `agent-context.js` — detects below-average eval dimensions and auto-injects improvement hints via `session-init.sh`. Max 3 hints, 5s timeout.
- **Wave-based parallel execution** (BM): `getWaveOrder(projectRoot, taskList)` in `ontology-engine.js` — topological sort via DEPENDS_ON relations, Kahn's algorithm, circular dependency handling. `ultrawork/SKILL.md` Step 2.5 integration.
- **Intent Gate** (BM): `hooks/intent-gate.sh` classifies UserPromptSubmit complexity (high/medium/low) → `.shinchan-docs/.intent-complexity`. `shinnosuke-orchestrate.md` Step 0.5 reads result for model tier override (Opus/Sonnet, never Haiku).
- `hooks/workflow-guard.sh`: git commit/push detection and blocking in execution stage, explicit allow in completion stage
- `tests/validate/workflow-guard-behavior.js`: TC-11 (execution + git commit → BLOCK), TC-12 (completion + git commit → ALLOW), TC-13 (execution + git push → BLOCK)

### Changed
- `hooks/workflow-guard.md`: Stage-Tool Matrix updated with git blocking rule for execution stage
- `hooks/hooks.json`: intent-gate registered in UserPromptSubmit (async: true, timeout: 5)
- `docs/workflow-guide.md`: Stage 3 section notes commit deferral to Stage 4

## [4.16.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **IntentGate** (BM): Shinnosuke RULE 0.5 — keyword-based auto-skill routing before domain routing. `agents/_shared/intent-map.json` with 10 keyword→skill mappings. Explicit skill calls always take priority (HR-1).
- **Plan Validation Gate** (BM): 3 quality checks added to `transition-gate.sh` for Stage 2→3 transitions — AC references per phase, file reference resolution, phase description specificity (≥20 chars).
- **Boulder Mechanism** (BM): Ralph v2 with idle detection (3 consecutive iterations without measurable progress), exponential backoff (0s→2s→4s→...→60s max), 15-iteration hard limit, and boulder-log.jsonl logging.
- **Hierarchical Context Injection** (BM): `src/gen-context-files.js` auto-generates per-directory `.context.md` files on SessionStart using ontology data. Background execution with 5s timeout.
- **Comment Checker** (BM): PostToolUse hook detects 5 AI slop comment patterns (`// TODO: implement`, `// FIXME:`, etc.) with warn-only decision (never blocks). Registered for Edit/Write matchers.
- **JSON Schema Generation** (BM): `src/gen-schemas.js` generates 3 JSON schemas (workflow-state, layer-map, intent-map) with `--check` mode for CI staleness detection.

### Changed
- `.gitignore`: added `**/.context.md` pattern and `src/gen-context-files.js`, `src/gen-schemas.js` whitelist entries
- `agents/bo.md`: added Context Loading section for `.context.md` awareness
- Validator filters: `agent-schema.js`, `skill-schema.js`, `agents-map.js` now exclude dot-prefixed files (`.context.md`)

### Fixed
- `transition-gate-behavior.js` TC-4b fixture updated to pass Plan Validation Gate checks

## [4.15.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Content extraction pipeline** (BM): masumi gains youtube/article/auto mode with yt-dlp/trafilatura environment probing and WebFetch fallback. agent-tool-guard adds masumi probe-only Bash exception. research/SKILL.md routes mode parameter to masumi.
- **Rubric LLM-as-Judge** (BM): actionkamen adds 3-item rubric scoring (Correctness/Completeness/Quality, 15pt, ≥9 pass), caller override support, and max-2-retry loop. micro-execute passes rubric: field to reviewers.
- **Competitive Code mode** (BM): debate/SKILL.md detects competitive triggers and routes to midori. midori orchestrates N Bo agents in worktree isolation, Action Kamen judges with rubric, winner merged via Bo Task, guaranteed cleanup on all paths.

## [4.14.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **inferLayer() regex**: match paths without trailing slash — fixes 92% of entities missing layer field
- **DomainConcept layer**: `scanDC()` now tracks `file_path` and calls `inferLayer()`
- **Test file detection**: recognize `tests/` directory files — 28 TestSuite entities now detected
- **merge() property update**: existing entities receive new properties during merge

### Results
- Layer coverage: 7% → 99%
- TestSuite detection: 0 → 28

## [4.14.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **LLM-driven ontology auto-scan** (BM-1): `auto-scan --check/--write` command in ontology-engine — LLM analyzes codebase to extract entities automatically with hallucination safeguards
- **ReACT Analysis Protocol** (BM-2): Structured Thought→Action→Observation→Answer cycle for Hiroshi and minimum tool-call principle for Misae
- **Structured agent step logging** (BM-3): Optional `step_type` field in work-tracker.jsonl for ReACT-style event tracking

### New Files
- `src/llm-ontology-scanner.js` — LLM scan core with caching and chunking
- `scripts/ontology-check.sh` — CI wrapper for ontology auto-scan --check

## [4.13.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Transition gate**: block `status: completed` unless current stage is `completion` — prevents skipping Stage 4 (code review, retrospective, implementation docs). Previously only artifact file existence was checked, allowing completion from any stage.
- Added TC-8/9/10 behavioral tests for stage skip prevention (16/16 passing)

## [4.13.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Statusline HUD**: use stdin `cwd` instead of `process.cwd()` to resolve `.shinchan-docs/` — fixes workflow state not showing when Claude Code runs the script from a different working directory
- **Statusline HUD**: fallback to `WORKFLOW_STATE.yaml` owner field when `.current-agent` file is missing

## [4.13.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Statusline HUD** (`src/statusline/index.js`): 2-line compact HUD using Claude Code's native statusLine API. Displays model, active workflow DOC_ID, stage, agent name, Todo progress (Line 1), and context usage bar with ANSI color coding, session cost, and elapsed time (Line 2).
- `/team-shinchan:setup-hud` command: installs/removes the HUD by writing `statusLine` configuration to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Detects plugin path at runtime (cache vs `--plugin-dir` mode). Confirms before overwriting existing statusLine configs.
- Zero npm dependencies; Node.js built-in only (`fs`, `path`). Graceful degradation when `.shinchan-docs/` is absent.

## [4.12.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Behavioral validators** — 5 new runtime behavior test validators for hard-guard hooks: `workflow-guard-behavior.js` (16 cases), `transition-gate-behavior.js` (13 cases), `agent-tool-guard-behavior.js` (14 cases), `layer-guard-behavior.js` (12 cases), `agent-routing.js` (40+ static checks). Total 54 behavioral test cases integrated into `index.js` (24 validators, ~7s).

### Discovered
- **HR-1 [Medium]**: `layer-guard.sh` defaults to `shinnosuke` (most-privileged) when `.current-agent` missing — privilege escalation path
- **HR-3 [Low]**: `transition-gate.sh` bypassed on new `WORKFLOW_STATE.yaml` creation
- **[Low]**: Reverse stage transitions not gated (undocumented)

## [4.11.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Scope change auto-absorption** — Shinnosuke RULE 0에 execution 중 scope 변경 감지 기준(4패턴+3반례), 처리 절차(4단계), `### Scope Change` 포맷 추가. Bo PO Workflow Step 1에 Scope Change 블록 확인 의무 추가. 워크플로우 이탈 없이 scope 변경을 PROGRESS.md에 자동 기록.

## [4.10.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Auto-generated plugin architecture map (`src/gen-architecture-map.js`) with agent hierarchy, 4-stage workflow, invariant rules, boundaries, and entry points. Supports `--write`/`--check` flags for CI integration.
- **Ontology 3-layer** — `layer` field (global/domain/local) added to ontology entities. Path-based auto-inference in scanner: agents/skills/hooks → global, src/ → domain, tests/ → local. Layer-aware `query --layer`, `summary`, and `healthScore` outputs.
- **Agent self-observation** — `src/agent-context.js` provides per-agent performance summaries from eval-history and work-tracker. Session-init caches results. 5 execution agents (bo, aichan, bunta, masao, kazama) now check their own performance history at session start.
- **harness-lint** — `arch: exists` and `arch: fresh` staleness checks for ARCHITECTURE.md

### Fixed
- **harness-lint** — plugin.json path corrected from `D('plugin.json')` to `D('.claude-plugin/plugin.json')` (ver: README/CHANGELOG checks now work)
- **validate/index.js** — Token budget warnings/errors separation bug fixed

## [4.9.1] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Memory system** — learnings.md heading format `##` → `###` (session-init.sh was loading 0 entries due to format mismatch)
- **Memory system** — Backfilled `**Tier**: procedural` in all 45 learnings entries (tier-aware scoring was degraded)
- **Memory system** — Added `memory: project` to 5 agents (aichan, bunta, midori, shiro, ume)
- **Ontology** — session-wrap.sh ontology refresh now calls ontology-scanner.js correctly (was calling non-existent `scan` command)
- **Ontology** — Scanner no longer runs `scanDestructuredExports` on .md/.sh/.json files (eliminated false positive components)
- **Ontology** — Cycle detection in healthScore() no longer double-counts (modularity score corrected)

### Added
- **memory-system.js** — Heading format and Tier field validation checks
- **session-init.sh** — Prune suggestion when learnings count exceeds 50
- **ontology-engine.js** — Plugin Entities section in KB summary (agents, hooks, skills by name)

## [4.9.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **Brainstorm skill** — New `/team-shinchan:brainstorm` skill for structured problem exploration before requirements. Invokes Hiroshi to produce: Problem Reframe, 2-4 Alternative Approaches (with pros/cons), Recommendation. Output saved as `brainstorm-output.md` for use by requirements skill.
- **Brainstorm command** — `commands/brainstorm.md` paired command file for skill registration

### Changed
- **Misae** — Socratic interview mode: exactly ONE question per turn, each with 2-3 concrete alternatives. IMMUTABLE RULES updated. Interview flow revised from batch questions to 5 sequential turns.
- **Bo** — Two-stage review (spec compliance + code quality via Action Kamen) generalized from micro-execute to standard Phase Loop. maxTurns 50→80. Phase Complexity Rule added (5+ sub-tasks → split into Steps).
- **requirements skill** — Step 0 brainstorm check: references prior brainstorm-output.md if found (advisory, not blocking)
- **Shinnosuke** — RULE 3 workflow table updated to show Brainstorm (Stage 0, optional) as pre-workflow step
- **workflow-guide.md** — Pre-Workflow Skill Chain section added: brainstorm → requirements → start chain documented
- **cross-refs.js** — `brainstorm` added to KNOWN_SKILLS array

## [4.8.0] - 2026-03-04

### Changed
- **Bo** — Redesigned from "Task Executor" to "Execution PO". Receives Phases from Shinnosuke, routes sub-tasks to domain specialists (Aichan/Bunta/Masao/Kazama) via Domain Routing Table, validates results, and reports back. maxTurns 30→50, memory local→project.
- **Shinnosuke** — Stage 3 Phase Loop updated: delegates Phases to Bo(PO) instead of routing directly to domain agents. RULE 0/1/2.5/3 updated. Quick Fix Path (RULE 2.5) explicitly bypasses Bo(PO).
- **layer-map.json** — 3 execution→specialist exceptions added (aichan, bunta, masao) for Bo(PO) delegation
- **output-formats.md** — Bo(PO) Delegation Format section added (before/after delegation, domain ambiguity, phase completion summary)
- **AGENTS.md** — Regenerated to reflect Bo's new role and maxTurns

## [4.7.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **TDD Enforcement skill** — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Iron Law with rationalization counters (7 entries), anti-patterns, and exception handling. Adopted from obra/superpowers.
- **Systematic Debugging skill** — 4-phase root-cause process (investigate, analyze, hypothesize, implement) with escalation rule (3+ failures → restart). Adopted from obra/superpowers.
- **Verification-Before-Completion skill** — Blocks completion claims without evidence. Red flags list, verification template, 4 checkpoint triggers. Strengthens self-check.md with evidence checkbox.
- **Parking Lot mechanism** — Discovered issues during execution are recorded in WORKFLOW_STATE.yaml `discovered_issues` instead of being fixed immediately. Triaged in Stage 4 Step 6 (promote/wontfix/resolved).
- **Scope Guard hook** — PreToolUse WARNING (not block) when Edit/Write targets files not listed in PROGRESS.md during execution stage. Guides agents to use parking lot for out-of-scope discoveries.
- **Mandatory Impact Scope Analysis** — Nene must grep for cross-references and paired files before writing any phase plan. Prevents missed file pairs (skill↔command, agent↔shared).
- **Skill-command content sync validator** — skill-command-parity.js now detects content drift (subagent_type mismatch, owner mismatch) between paired files.

### Changed
- **Bo, Kazama** — Required Sub-Skills section added: must use TDD, systematic debugging, and verification skills during implementation
- **Action Kamen** — Verification Evidence Check added to review criteria (rejects completion reports without evidence)
- **Nene** — Micro-task rules strengthened: 2-5 min scope, RED-GREEN commit cycle (Rule 8), rejection criteria for ambiguous instructions (Rule 9), Plan Quality Gate table
- **Coding Principles** — Surgical Changes now includes Parking Lot Rule: park scope-external issues, don't fix directly
- **Self-check** — Added Impact Scope Complete and Scope Discipline (parking lot) checkboxes

### Fixed
- **commands/start.md** — Stage 1 owner changed from nene to misae (was out of sync with skills/start/SKILL.md)
- **Misae** — Added Task tool for subagent delegation (Shiro/Ume) during Stage 1

## [4.6.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **Micro-execute skill** — Breaks implementation into 2-3 minute micro-tasks with fresh subagent per task. Two-stage review per task: spec compliance then code quality. Retry limits and final integration review. Inspired by obra/superpowers subagent-driven-development pattern.
- **Subagent prompt templates** — Reusable structured prompts for implementer, spec-reviewer, and code-quality-reviewer in `agents/_shared/micro-task-prompts/`
- **Stage 4 completion enforcement** — HARD-GATE ensures RETROSPECTIVE.md and IMPLEMENTATION.md are always written. Bo writes docs, Action Kamen does final review.

### Changed
- **Misae expanded to Stage 1 owner** — Now handles full requirements gathering: user interviews, REQUESTS.md creation, STRIDE analysis, and hidden requirements discovery
- **Nene simplified to Stage 2 only** — Focused purely on PROGRESS.md planning from approved requirements. Removed interview and requirements logic.
- **Start workflow** — Stage 1 now routes to Misae (was Nene). Separate Misae post-analysis step removed (integrated into Misae's flow).
- **Autopilot workflow** — Updated to use micro-execute pattern and explicit Stage 4 completion

### Fixed
- **Stage 4 silently skipped** — Shinnosuke had no executable logic for Stage 4 transition. Added 5-step completion sequence with HARD-GATE.
- **KNOWN_SKILLS drift** — Synced layer-enforcement.js with cross-refs.js (added eval, ontology, impact-analysis, design-review)

## [4.4.1] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Remove all 14 prompt hooks** — prompt hooks make extra Haiku API calls and require `{"ok": true}` JSON responses; our hooks never returned this format, causing "hook error" on every tool use. SessionStart prompt hooks additionally crash with "ToolUseContext required". All guardrail logic already handled by command hooks (shell scripts). 32 → 22 hooks, 39KB → 6.7KB hooks.json.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: All prompt hooks erroring** — prompt `"prompt"` field is literal text sent to the model, NOT a file path. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is only resolved in command hooks. All 14 prompt hooks now have their .md content inlined directly into hooks.json.
- **run.cjs stdin race condition** — simplified to `data`/`end`/`error` events with timeout fallback; removed problematic `readable` + `destroy` pattern
- **workflow-guard `.shinchan-docs/` exception** — workflow infrastructure writes are now always allowed regardless of stage

## [4.3.3] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Hook errors in external projects** — `run.cjs` stdin race condition where `readable` event consumed data before `data` event, causing all command hooks to error
- **workflow-guard blocking `.shinchan-docs/` writes** — prompt hook had "NO EXCEPTIONS" rule that blocked WORKFLOW_STATE.yaml creation during requirements stage; added `.shinchan-docs/` exception for workflow infrastructure
- **`mkdir .shinchan-docs/` blocked** — workflow-guard.sh now allows `mkdir` targeting `.shinchan-docs/` during requirements/planning stages

## [4.3.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Hooks not loading** — `"prompt_file"` field renamed to `"prompt"` in all 14 prompt hook entries; Claude Code schema expects `"prompt"` for `type: "prompt"` hooks
- **Duplicate hooks file error** — Removed `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"` from plugin.json; auto-discovery handles this, explicit field caused fatal duplicate detection

## [4.3.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **BASH_SOURCE path resolution**: Use `${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}` fallback for reliable path resolution when hooks are invoked via `bash <script>` (deny-check, layer-guard, session-init, session-wrap, ontology-auto-build)
- **run.cjs stdin timeout**: Increased from 50ms to 200ms with `readable` event detection to prevent intermittent hook failures
- **run.cjs exit code propagation**: Now propagates exit code 2 for block decisions
- **Sandboxed environment compatibility**: Use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` instead of hardcoded `/tmp` in ontology-auto-build
- **gzip availability check**: Verify `gzip` exists before background compression in write-tracker
- **openssl fallback**: Robust trace ID generation when `openssl` is unavailable in trace-init

### Added
- **Hook execution validator** (`tests/validate/hook-execution.js`): 109-assertion automated test suite covering JSON schema, file existence, permissions, run.cjs wrapper, stdin piping, and block detection
- **matcher field enforcement**: All 32 hook entries now have explicit `"matcher"` field for reliable hook loading

## [4.3.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Node.js hook runner** (`scripts/run.cjs`): Cross-platform wrapper for reliable hook execution in marketplace installs — mirrors oh-my-claudecode pattern
- **Commit lint hook** (`hooks/commit-lint.sh`): Enforces Git R-1 conventional commit format (`type(scope): description`, 72-char limit)
- **Branch naming rule** (`hooks/deny-list.json`): Enforces Git R-4 branch naming convention (`{type}/{description}`)
- **Version consistency hook** (`hooks/version-check.md`): PostToolUse prompt hook enforces Git R-13 version consistency across plugin.json, marketplace.json, README.md
- **Dependency pinning check** (`hooks/security-check.sh`): Blocks `"*"` and `"latest"` in package.json (Security R-9)
- **Setup skill** (`/team-shinchan:setup`): First-time installation onboarding and health check
- **Agent memory expansion**: 5 additional agents now have persistent project memory — shinnosuke, nene, misae, masao, himawari (total: 10/15)

### Changed
- All hook commands now use Node.js wrapper (`node run.cjs <script>`) for reliable marketplace execution
- Shell scripts use `set -eo pipefail` instead of `set -euo pipefail` across all 12 hooks
- Removed explicit `"hooks"` field from plugin.json — relies on auto-discovery of `hooks/hooks.json`
- Rules auto-enforcement expanded from 9/54 to 13/54

### Fixed
- Hooks not executing in marketplace installs due to direct shell invocation differences

## [4.2.2] - 2026-02-28

### Bug Fixes
- **Ontology not building in marketplace installs**: Plugin command hooks (`type: "command"`) are not executed by Claude Code in marketplace installs. Simplified `ontology-auto-build.md` prompt hook to invoke the `.sh` script via Bash, ensuring ontology builds regardless.
- **Silent hook failures**: Removed `-u` flag from `set -euo pipefail` to prevent unbound variable crashes in hook scripts.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-02-27

### Bug Fixes
- **ontology-integrity.js**: Fix `rel.type` → `rel.relation` field alignment — resolves 75 false-positive validation errors
- **workflow-guard.sh**: Allow read-only Bash (git log, ls, etc.) during requirements/planning stages — was blocking all Bash
- **budget-guard.sh**: Strip YAML comment lines before parsing — prevents matching commented-out values
- **agent-tool-guard.sh**: Block compound commands in actionkamen test exception — prevents `mkdir && npm test` bypass
- **transition-gate.sh**: Handle Edit tool partial stage replacements — detects bare stage names in old/new strings

### Improvements
- **Agent frontmatter**: Add missing `maxTurns`/`permissionMode` to himawari, misae, shinnosuke, ume, midori
- **README**: Update plugin inventory counts — 34 hooks (21 cmd + 13 prompt), 21 validators, 41 skills, 9 src scripts
- **Ontology scanner**: Plugin-aware cross-reference detection for .md/.sh files, health scoring calibrated (connectivity target 3.0 → 1.5)

## [4.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### New Features — Full Enforcement Audit & Hardening
- **budget-guard.sh**: Programmatic budget enforcement — hard block at 100% when `hard_limit: true`, warns at 80% (replaces prompt-only budget guard)
- **transition-gate.sh**: Stage transition prerequisite validation — blocks advancement without required artifacts (REQUESTS.md, PROGRESS.md, Action Kamen review)
- **session-wrap.sh**: Deterministic budget counter persistence on session end — fixes compounding failure where budget counters never updated
- **trace-init.sh**: Deterministic trace ID generation per user prompt — replaces unreliable prompt-based trace generation
- **agent-tool-guard.sh**: Read-only agent enforcement — blocks Edit/Write/destructive Bash for advisory/utility agents (hiroshi, actionkamen, misae, shiro, masumi, ume, nene)

### Improvements
- **security-check.sh**: Large file staging block — rejects `git add` of files >10MB
- **deny-list.json**: Added `git add .`/`git add -A` block (Git R-11) and `eval()` block (Security R-10)
- **Harness Engineering**: 6 structural improvements — state migrator, eval metrics, layer guard, phase-aware KB loading, budget hard limits
- **Plugin Portability**: All 15 agent path references fixed (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`), SessionStart command hooks for ontology and KB
- **Workflow Enforcement**: workflow-guard.sh blocks code tools during requirements/planning stages

### Stats
- Command hooks: 11 → 21 (+10)
- Total hooks: 24 → 34
- Enforcement coverage: 18 identified gaps → 18 addressed
- New files: 10 shell scripts, 2 JS modules

## [4.1.1] - 2026-02-26

### Bug Fixes
- **Ontology Scanner**: Fix 4 critical bugs — Component detection for `module.exports = { Name }`, DEPENDS_ON wiring for DataModel files, TESTED_BY cross-directory matching via import analysis, API entity missing `name` field
- **Ontology Engine**: Add `name` to API schema props, `file_path` to DataModel schema props, support entity name lookup in impact/related CLI

### Improvements
- **Workflow Drift Prevention**: Enforce active workflow context in orchestrator hook — block "Simple question"/"Quick fix" classification when workflow is active, always show current position, guide back after unrelated questions
- **Agent Narration Rule**: Shinnosuke must announce every delegation (before: who/why, after: result/next step) and show Phase progress at every transition
- **Agent Auto-Integration**: Nene auto-runs impact/related during planning, Bo auto-rescans after phase completion, ActionKamen auto-checks health during review, session-wrap auto-refreshes ontology on session end
- **Minimal User Commands**: Reduce user-facing commands from 40 to 5 (`start`, `resume`, `autopilot`, `review`, `help`); 35 internal skills set to `user-invocable: false`
