Before making this change, verify:

1. **Think Before Coding**: Have you stated your assumptions? Is the scope clear?
2. **Simplicity First**: Is this the minimum code needed? No unnecessary abstractions?
3. **Surgical Changes**: Are you ONLY changing what was requested? No adjacent "improvements"?
4. **Goal-Driven Execution**: What is the success criteria? How will you verify?
