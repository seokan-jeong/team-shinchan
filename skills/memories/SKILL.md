# Memories Skill

**View what Team-Shinchan has learned about this project.**

## Usage

```bash
/team-shinchan:memories              # View all learnings
/team-shinchan:memories pattern      # Filter by category
/team-shinchan:memories search auth  # Search for keyword
```

## Process

### Step 1: Read Learning File

Read `.shinchan-docs/learnings.md`

If file doesn't exist:
```
📚 [Memories] No learnings yet.

Start teaching with:
  /team-shinchan:learn "Your learning here"

Or just work - I learn automatically after tasks!
```

### Step 2: Parse and Display

**Full view** (`/memories`):

```
